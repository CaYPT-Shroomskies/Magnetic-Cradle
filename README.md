# Magnetic Cradle for IYPT 2026

Just wrote this for funsies cause i was bored this morning and wanted to do some vector bashing

Work is done by Luyu for team Shroomskies (CaYPT)

Please accredit if you use any part of it :D

Uses current cylinder model (Biot-Savart and Lorentz integrations for magnet interaction) to solve for force.
Damping is simple viscous damping.
